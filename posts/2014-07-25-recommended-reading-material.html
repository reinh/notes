<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>
<p>For <strong>Haskell</strong>, I suggest <em>Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming</em> <span class="citation">[Thompson 1999]</span> and <em>Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell</em> <span class="citation">[Bird 1998]</span>. <em>Real World Haskell</em> <span class="citation">[O’Sullivan et al. 2008]</span> can be used but it must be read carefully as it is out of date and contains a significant number of errata.</p>
<p>For <strong>Category Theory</strong>, I suggest Lawvere's <em>Conceptual Mathematics</em> <span class="citation">[2009]</span>, Awodey's <em>Category Theory</em> <span class="citation">[2010]</span>, and Mac Lane's <em>Categories for the Working Mathematician</em> <span class="citation">[Lane 1998]</span>, in that order. Alternatively, the order can be reversed: Mac Lane can be used as a forcing function to read Awodey; and Awodey can be used as a forcing function to read Lawvere.</p>
<p>For <strong>Abstract Algebra</strong>, and as preparation for Category Theory, I recommend Mac Lane's <em>Algebra</em> <span class="citation">[1999]</span>. Lang's <em>Algebra</em> <span class="citation">[2002]</span> might be useful as a reference, or if you're <em>really</em> interested in abstract algebra.</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<dl>
<dt>How to Prove It <span class="citation">[Velleman 2006]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/prove-it.jpg" alt="How to Prove It Cover" /> A wonderful book that introduces a structured method for proving things. Required reading for anyone who is interested in writing or understanding proofs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Introduction to Logic <span class="citation">[Tarski 2013]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/logic.jpg" alt="Introduction to Logic Cover" /> A monumental work by one of the greatest logicians of all time. Everyone should read this book.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="haskell">Haskell</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell <span class="citation">[Bird 1998]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/bird-intro-fp.jpg" alt="Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell Cover" /> One of the best introductory books on programming ever written. As the title suggests, this is not so much a Haskell book as a FP book that happens to <em>use</em> Haskell. It won't teach you how to use libraries or spend much time on pragmatic issues, but it <em>will</em> teach you how to think about programs in a functional way.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Programming in Haskell <span class="citation">[Hutton 2007]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/programming-in-haskell.jpg" alt="Programming in Haskell Cover" /> Focuses on core langauge concepts and avoids advanced topics. It's somewhat lightweight at only 171 pages, and its organization is a bit strange, but it is an excellent introduction to the Haskell language.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Real World Haskell <span class="citation">[O’Sullivan et al. 2008]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/real-world-haskell.jpg" alt="Real World Haskell Cover" /> This book presents a pragmatic introduction to writing Haskell with a focus on performance. Unfortunately, it contains a number of errata and has become somewhat obsolete. Use the online version and read the comments as many of them correct errors or explain other issues. Also see this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23733494/2225384">summary of issues</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming <span class="citation">[Doets and Eijck 2004]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/haskell-road.jpg" alt="The Haskell Road to Logic Cover" /> This isn't so much a Haskell book as a math book that uses Haskell for its examples. That said, it's a wonderful introduction to the sort of mathematics that you can express in Haskell (which is quite a lot).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming <span class="citation">[Thompson 1999]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/haskell-thompson.jpg" alt="Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming Cover" /> A well organized introductory text that does a good job of teaching and motivating the functional perspective. Might be paced a bit slowly for some, but others will enjoy its thoroughness.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell <span class="citation">[Marlow 2013]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/marlow-book.jpg" alt="Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell Cover" /> Written by one of the implementors of Haskell's parallel runtime. Absolutely wonderful book.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="cateogry-theory">Cateogry Theory</h2>
<p><em>See also: Edward Kmett's <a href="http://www.quora.com/Category-Theory/What-is-the-best-textbook-for-Category-theory">list on Quora</a>.</em></p>
<dl>
<dt>Conceptual Mathematics <span class="citation">[Lawvere and Schanuel 2009]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/lawvere.jpg" alt="Conceptual Mathematics Cover" /> A Category Theory text with few prerequisites, suitable for a &quot;motivated high-schooler&quot;. This is a great introduction to Category Theory for folks without a mathematical background and will prepare you to read some of the more advanced texts that follow.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Categories for the Working Mathematician <span class="citation">[Lane 1998]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/maclane-categories.jpg" alt="Categories for the Working Mathematician Cover" /> Written for &quot;working mathematicians&quot;, this dense book is a considerable challenge even for graduate students. That said, it's also the most comprehensive and thorough Category Theory text, written by one of the founders of the discipline.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Category Theory <span class="citation">[Awodey 2010]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/awodey.jpg" alt="Category Theory Cover" /> The standard modern text on Category Theory, and the best all around introduction. Sits somewhere between <span class="citation">Lawvere and Schanuel [2009]</span> and <span class="citation">Lane [1998]</span> in difficulty. Highly recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Abstract and Concrete Categories: The Joy of Cats <span class="citation">[Ad<span>á</span>mek et al. 2009]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/joy-of-cats.jpg" alt="Joy of Cats Cover" /> Sits somewhere between <span class="citation">Lawvere and Schanuel [2009]</span> and <span class="citation">Awodey [2010]</span> in difficulty. A good introductory text, but mostly redundant if you're already reading those two. It might be useful as a bridge between Lawvere and Awodey for some people.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="abstract-algebra">Abstract Algebra</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Algebra <span class="citation">[Lane and Birkhoff 1999]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/maclane-algebra.jpg" alt="Algebra Cover" /> In the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHDPXKDJRWA2/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0821816462&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books">words</a> of one of Mac Lane's students, &quot;I know of no book on pure mathematics more worth reading than this one&quot;. Introduces algebra methodically and thoroughly from first principles. A much easier book than <em>Categories for the Working Mathematician</em> <span class="citation">[Lane 1998]</span>, <em>Algebra</em> will introduce you to Mac Lane's idiosyncratic style and is an excellent preparation for Category Theory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Algebra <span class="citation">[Lang 2002]</span></dt>
<dd><p><img src="../images/lang.jpg" alt="Algebra Cover" /> Weighing in at over 900 pages, Lang is somewhere between an graduate-level textbook and some sort of beastiary of algebraic structures. Lang introduced a novel pedagogy for algebra that borowed new ways of thinking from category theory and homological algebra, which has influenced subsequent books.</p>
