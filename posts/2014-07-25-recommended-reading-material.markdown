# Suggestions

For **Haskell**, I suggest *Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming* [@thompson1999haskell]
and *Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell* [@Bird98:Introduction].
*Real World Haskell* [@o2008real] can be used but it must be read carefully as it is out of date and contains a significant number of errata.

For **Category Theory**, I suggest Lawvere's *Conceptual Mathematics* [-@lawvere2009conceptual], Awodey's *Category Theory* [-@awodey2010category],
and Mac Lane's *Categories for the Working Mathematician* [@lane1998categories], in that order.
Alternatively, the order can be reversed: Mac Lane can be used as a forcing function to read Awodey;
and Awodey can be used as a forcing function to read Lawvere.

For **Abstract Algebra**, and as preparation for Category Theory, I recommend Mac&nbsp;Lane's *Algebra* [-@lane1999algebra].
Lang's *Algebra* [-@lang2002algebra] might be useful as a reference, or if you're *really* interested in abstract algebra.

# General

How to Prove It [@velleman2006prove]
  ~ ![How to Prove It Cover](/images/prove-it.jpg)

    A wonderful book that introduces a structured method for proving things.
    Required reading for anyone who is interested in writing or understanding proofs.

Introduction to Logic [@tarski2013introduction]
  ~ ![Introduction to Logic Cover](/images/logic.jpg)
    A monumental work by one of the greatest logicians of all time.
    Everyone should read this book.

# Haskell

Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell [@Bird98:Introduction]
  ~ ![Introduction to Functional Programming using Haskell Cover](/images/bird-intro-fp.jpg)
    One of the best introductory books on programming ever written.
    As the title suggests, this is not so much a Haskell book as a FP book that happens to *use* Haskell.
    It won't teach you how to use libraries or spend much time on pragmatic issues,
    but it *will* teach you how to think about programs in a functional way.

Programming in Haskell [@hutton2007programming]
  ~ ![Programming in Haskell Cover](/images/programming-in-haskell.jpg)
    Focuses on core langauge concepts and avoids advanced topics.
    It's somewhat lightweight at only 171 pages, and its organization is a bit strange,
    but it is an excellent introduction to the Haskell language.

Real World Haskell [@o2008real]
  ~ ![Real World Haskell Cover](/images/real-world-haskell.jpg)
    This book presents a pragmatic introduction to writing Haskell with a focus on performance.
    Unfortunately, it contains a number of errata and has become somewhat obsolete.
    Use the online version and read the comments as many of them correct errors or explain other issues.
    Also see this [summary of issues][caveats].

The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming [@doets2004haskell]
  ~ ![The Haskell Road to Logic Cover](/images/haskell-road.jpg)
    This isn't so much a Haskell book as a math book that uses Haskell for its examples.
    That said, it's a wonderful introduction to the sort of mathematics that you can express in Haskell (which is quite a lot).

Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming [@thompson1999haskell]
  ~ ![Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming Cover](/images/haskell-thompson.jpg)
    A well organized introductory text that does a good job of teaching and motivating the functional perspective.
    Might be paced a bit slowly for some, but others will enjoy its thoroughness.

Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell [@marlow2013parallel]
  ~ ![Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell Cover](/images/marlow-book.jpg)
    Written by one of the implementors of Haskell's parallel runtime. Absolutely wonderful book.

# Cateogry Theory

Conceptual Mathematics [@lawvere2009conceptual]
  ~ ![Conceptual Mathematics Cover](/images/lawvere.jpg)
    A Category Theory text with few prerequisites, suitable for a "motivated high-schooler".
    This is a great introduction to Category Theory for folks without a mathematical background
    and will prepare you to read some of the more advanced texts that follow.

Categories for the Working Mathematician [@lang2002algebra]
  ~ ![Categories for the Working Mathematician Cover](/images/maclane-categories.jpg)
    Written for "working mathematicians", this dense book is a considerable challenge even for graduate students.
    That said, it's also the most comprehensive and thorough Category Theory text, written by one of the founders of the discipline.

Category Theory [@awodey2010category]
  ~ ![Category Theory Cover](/images/awodey.jpg)
    The standard modern text on Category Theory, and the best all around introduction.
    Sits somewhere between @lawvere2009conceptual and @lane1998categories in difficulty.
    Highly recommended.

Abstract and Concrete Categories: The Joy of Cats [@ad√°mek2009abstract]
  ~ ![Joy of Cats Cover](/images/joy-of-cats.jpg)
    Sits somewhere between @lawvere2009conceptual and @awodey2010category in difficulty.
    A good introductory text, but mostly redundant if you're already reading those two.
    It might be useful as a bridge between Lawvere and Awodey for some people.

# Abstract Algebra

Algebra [@lane1999algebra]
  ~ ![Algebra Cover](/images/maclane-algebra.jpg)
    In the [words] of one of Mac Lane's students,
    "I know of no book on pure mathematics more worth reading than this one".
    Introduces algebra methodically and thoroughly from first principles.
    A much easier book than *Categories for the Working Mathematician* [@lane1998categories],
    *Algebra* will introduce you to Mac Lane's idiosyncratic style
    and is an excellent preparation for Category Theory.

Algebra [@lang2002algebra]
  ~ ![Algebra Cover](/images/lang.jpg)
    Weighing in at over 900 pages, Lang is somewhere between an graduate-level textbook
    and some sort of beastiary of algebraic structures.
    Lang introduced a novel pedagogy for algebra that borowed new ways of thinking
    from category theory and homological algebra,
    which has influenced subsequent books.
