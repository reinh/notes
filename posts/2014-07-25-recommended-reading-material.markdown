# Haskell

Learn You a Haskell [@lipovača2011learn]
  ~ Recommended as a first introduction to Haskell. Focuses on typeclasses.

Introduction to Functional Programming [@bird1990introduction]
  ~ Blah blah blah

Real World Haskell [@o2008real]
  ~ Written by a few of the most prolific Haskell developers, this book presents a pragmatic introduction to Haskell.
    Unfortunately, it contains a number of errata and many sections have become obsolete.
    I recommend that you use the online version and read the comments as many of them correct errors or confusing wordings in the original.
    Also be sure to read this [summary of caveats and issues][caveats], listed by chapter.

[caveats]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23733494/2225384

The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming [@doets2004haskell]
  ~ Blah blah

Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming [@thompson1999haskell]
  ~ A description.

# Cateogry Theory

*See also Edward Kmett's [list on Quora][ed].*

Conceptual Mathematics [@lawvere2009conceptual]
  ~ A Category Theory text with few prerequisites, suitable for a "motivated high-schooler".
    This is a great introduction to Category Theory for folks without a mathematical background
    and will prepare you to read some of the more advanced texts that follow.

Categories for the Working Mathematician [@lang2002algebra]
  ~ Written for "working mathematicians", this dense book is a considerable challenge even for graduate students.
    That said, it's also the most comprehensive and thorough Category Theory text, written by one of the founders of the discipline.

Category Theory [@awodey2010category]
  ~ The standard modern text on Category Theory, and the best all around introduction.
    Sits somewhere between @lawvere2009conceptual and @lane1998categories in difficulty.
    Highly recommended.

Abstract and Concrete Categories: The Joy of Cats [@adámek2009abstract]
  ~ Sits somewhere between @lawvere2009conceptual and @awodey2010category in difficulty.
    A decent introductory text, but mostly redundant if you're alreading those two.

# Abstract Algebra

Algebra [@lang2002algebra]
  ~ A description.

Algebra [@lane1999algebra]
  ~ A description.
